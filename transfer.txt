in vba, i have a cell taht contains data in the following format: arbitrarystring (text). i want to be able extract the data between the parenthesis in vba to a variable. for example, i want a line that would be vari = "text", having found the string between the parenthesis. this should be dynamic to work with any length arbitrarystring and text
Sub ExtractText()
    Dim cellValue As String
    Dim textToExtract As String
    Dim openParenPos As Long
    Dim closeParenPos As Long
    
    ' Assuming your cell value is in A1
    cellValue = Range("A1").Value
    
    ' Find the positions of opening and closing parentheses
    openParenPos = InStr(1, cellValue, "(")
    closeParenPos = InStr(openParenPos + 1, cellValue, ")")
    
    If openParenPos > 0 And closeParenPos > 0 Then
        ' Extract the text between parentheses
        textToExtract = Mid(cellValue, openParenPos + 1, closeParenPos - openParenPos - 1)
        MsgBox "Extracted Text: " & textToExtract
    Else
        MsgBox "No parentheses found in the cell."
    End If
End Sub
