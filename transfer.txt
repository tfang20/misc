in python, i have a dataframe df. i want to use column "type". i want to create a new dataframe df2 that is made up of all the rows in column type that are "A" or "B". df2 should automatically have the same headers as d1. i want the rest, where in "type" is not "A" or "B", in df3
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df is your original DataFrame
# Filter rows with "A" or "B" in the "type" column
df2 = df[df['type'].isin(['A', 'B'])].copy()

# Create df3 by excluding rows with "A" or "B" in the "type" column
df3 = df[~df['type'].isin(['A', 'B'])].copy()

# df2 and df3 will automatically have the same headers as df
