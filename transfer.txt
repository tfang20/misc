in python, i have a dataframe. column one is labels, and so are rows 1,2,3,4, and 5. In row 6 and 7 (not including column 1), i want to color the cells based on their numeric value. if the value is 0, it will not be colored. the more positive the value is, the more green it should be. the more negative the value is, the more red it should be. for example, a cell of -2 and a cell of -1 will both be red, but -2 will be a darker red; likewise, cell of 1 and cell of 2 will both be green, but 2 will be darker green. after the coloring is done, i want the dataframe converted to html.
