in vba, i have code that pulls an excel from an api. that is, the api request returns an xls file that can be downloaded. i want to copy a worksheet called "HistoryData" and paste into the existing workbook the vba code is in, all without actually downloading the returned xls file. show me

Sub CopyWorksheetFromAPI()
    Dim apiURL As String
    Dim dataWorkbook As Workbook
    Dim historyDataSheet As Worksheet
    Dim existingWorkbook As Workbook
    
    ' Replace "apiURL" with the actual API endpoint that returns the Excel file
    apiURL = "https://api.example.com/get_excel_data"
    
    ' Download the Excel file from the API into a new workbook
    Workbooks.Open apiURL
    Set dataWorkbook = ActiveWorkbook
    
    ' Set the worksheet you want to copy from the downloaded workbook
    Set historyDataSheet = dataWorkbook.Worksheets("HistoryData")
    
    ' Set the existing workbook (where you want to paste the data)
    Set existingWorkbook = ThisWorkbook
    
    ' Copy the "HistoryData" worksheet from the downloaded workbook and paste into the existing workbook
    historyDataSheet.Copy After:=existingWorkbook.Sheets(existingWorkbook.Sheets.Count)
    
    ' Close the downloaded workbook without saving changes
    dataWorkbook.Close SaveChanges:=False
End Sub
