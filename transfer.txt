Natural gas market trades a lot of options, and options have volatility. Volatility is basically how much the price of the option can change over a short period of time, and it's a big point in people's transaction decisions. There's implied volatility, which is what the market forecasts the volatility of the contract to be, and realized volatility, which is historically what the volatility actually realized on x day. Using a combo of Python and VBA, I created a tool that pulls and compiles data to model average realized volatility vs implied volatility over different rolling bases (15 day, 30 day, etc.) for monthly natural gas contracts over a 6 year basis.
