this is my code. when it bottom borders the rows, it is skipping the cells in col D and col I because there is already a right border on the column: 
run_count = 0
model_count = 0
first = 1
for row in ws.iter_rows(min_row=2):
    if first == 1:
        if run_count == 7:
            for cell in row:
                cell.border = openpyxl.styles.Border(bottom = openpyxl.styles.Side(style='dashed'))
                run_count = 0
                first = 0
    if run_count == 8:
            for cell in row:
                cell.border = openpyxl.styles.Border(bottom = openpyxl.styles.Side(style='dashed'))
                run_count = 0
    if model_count == 23:
        for cell2 in row:
            cell2.border = openpyxl.styles.Border(bottom = openpyxl.styles.Side(style='thin'))
    run_count += 1
    model_count += 1
# Add a regular border to the right of column D
for row in ws.iter_rows(min_row = 2, min_col=4, max_col=4):
    for cell in row:
        cell.border = Border(right=Side(style='thin'))

# Add a regular border to the right of column I
for row in ws.iter_rows(min_row = 2, min_col=9, max_col=9):
    for cell in row:
        cell.border = Border(right=Side(style='thin'))
