A secretive society has 4 towers, each with a certain number of floors.
The number of floors in each tower is the smallest prime number greater than the square of the towerâ€™s position (e.g., Tower 1, Tower 2...).

On each floor of a tower, there are 5 rooms.
Each room contains a magical orb, and each orb holds a number of gems equal to twice the floor number on which it resides.

The society collects all the gems from every tower, combines them, and divides the total by the number of towers.

Finally, they subtract the sum of the first two odd Fibonacci numbers and divide the result by the number of towers again.

What is the final result?

Function GetUniqueValues(ColumnRange As Range) As Variant
    Dim Dict As Object
    Dim Cell As Range
    Dim UniqueValues() As Variant
    Dim i As Long
    
    ' Create a dictionary to store unique values
    Set Dict = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")
    
    ' Loop through each cell in the column range
    For Each Cell In ColumnRange
        If Not IsEmpty(Cell.Value) Then
            ' Add value to dictionary if it doesn't already exist
            If Not Dict.exists(Cell.Value) Then
                Dict.Add Cell.Value, Nothing
            End If
        End If
    Next Cell
    
    ' Resize array to the number of unique values
    ReDim UniqueValues(1 To Dict.Count)
    
    ' Populate array with unique values from dictionary
    i = 1
    For Each Key In Dict.Keys
        UniqueValues(i) = Key
        i = i + 1
    Next Key
    
    ' Return the array
    GetUniqueValues = UniqueValues
End Function
