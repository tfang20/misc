in excel, i have columns of data: date, x, y. the dates are in 3 clusters: june 2023, july 2023, august 2023. i want to create a chart in excel using either regular excel or vba to display a scatter plot of x vs y. i want the x vs y relationship in the scatter to be broken down by month. basically, it should look like three graphs in one. the x axis resets to 0 per month. so, it will be x vs y for june 2023, then immediately x vs y for july 2023, then immediately x vs y for august 2023. the x should reset per month. how do i do this
