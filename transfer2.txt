in excel, i have columns of data: date, x, y. the dates are in 3 clusters: june 2023, july 2023, august 2023. i want to create a chart in excel using either regular excel or vba to display a scatter plot of x vs y. i want the x vs y relationship in the scatter to be broken down by month. basically, it should look like three graphs in one. the x axis resets to 0 per month. so, it will be x vs y for june 2023, then immediately x vs y for july 2023, then immediately x vs y for august 2023. the x should reset per month. how do i do this


To create a scatter plot in Excel that displays the relationship between x and y values broken down by month, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Organize your data
Ensure that your data is organized in columns, with the first column containing the dates, the second column containing the x values, and the third column containing the y values.

Step 2: Insert a scatter plot
Select the range of data you want to include in the scatter plot, including the dates, x values, and y values. Then, go to the "Insert" tab in Excel, click on "Scatter" in the "Charts" section, and choose the scatter plot type you prefer. Excel will insert a basic scatter plot chart on your worksheet.

Step 3: Modify the chart
Right-click on the chart and select "Select Data" from the context menu. In the "Select Data Source" dialog box, click on the "Add" button under the "Legend Entries (Series)" section.

Step 4: Specify series name and values
In the "Edit Series" dialog box, enter a series name for the first month (e.g., "June 2023") in the "Series name" field. For the "Series X values," select the dates corresponding to that month. For the "Series Y values," select the corresponding y values. Click "OK" to close the dialog box.

Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 for the other two months (July 2023 and August 2023), specifying the appropriate series names, X values, and Y values.

Step 5: Adjust the axis
Right-click on the X-axis of the chart and select "Format Axis" from the context menu. In the "Axis Options" pane, change the "Minimum" value to 0 to reset the X-axis for each month. Click "Close" to apply the changes.

Step 6: Customize the chart
You can further customize the chart by adding titles, labels, adjusting colors, and applying other formatting options as desired.
